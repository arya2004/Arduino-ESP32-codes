## Introduction

The ESP32 is a versatile microcontroller that combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity with powerful processing capabilities. It is widely used for IoT (Internet of Things) applications, home automation, robotics, and more. This repository aims to provide a collection of ESP32/Arduino codes that can serve as a starting point for your own projects or as a reference for learning and experimenting with the ESP32 platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ESP32/Arduino codes in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/arya2004/microcontroller-projects.git
   ```
2. Set up the Arduino IDE for ESP32 development. Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions on installing the necessary tools and libraries: [ESP32 Arduino Core](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/).
3. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
4. Explore the available codes, examples, and projects. Open the corresponding `.ino` files to view the code and upload it to your ESP32 board.
5. Follow any specific instructions or requirements mentioned in the code comments or README files within each project folder.

## Usage

Each code example or project within this repository has its own purpose and functionality. To use a specific code, follow these general steps:

1. Open the corresponding `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE's Tools menu.
4. Customize any necessary settings or variables within the code, such as Wi-Fi credentials or pin assignments.
5. Upload the code to your ESP32 board by clicking the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE.
6. Monitor the serial output for any debug or informational messages.

Refer to the specific code or project's README file or comments for additional instructions or details.
